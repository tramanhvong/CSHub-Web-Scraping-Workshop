# Step 1: Install Prerequesites and Clone this Repo:

For this workshop we are using python so if you want to follow along make sure you install it.



To get started, we will need a few things. First, Make sure to download Google Chrome and the accompanying ChromeDriver. Additionally we need the Selenium Library.

Install Google Chrome & Chrome Driver Here:

Google Chrome -> https://www.google.com/intl/en_ca/chrome/

ChromeDriver -> https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/downloads

Next, we need Selenium and beatifulsoup. To install selenium, simply open your terminal and enter:

```
pip install selenium
```

```
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

Once you have installed everything, we can now clone the repo to obtain the starter code. If you do not have Github Desktop or Git Make sure to download it.


# Step 2: File Orgnization

After downloading your ChromeDriver, make sure you put it in the same file the project is in. It should look something like this:

# Step 3: Have Fun!

If you have done everything correctly, you should be good to go! Whether you want to code along with me or play around with the tools on your own is up to you, but I hope this workshop taught you something new and gave you motivation to get out there and build your own projects!
